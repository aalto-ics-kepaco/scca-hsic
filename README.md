# Sparse Non-Linear CCA through Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion

This repository contains the MATLAB codes applied in the experiments of [1].

## Contents

* The **scca-hsic** folder contains the implementation of SCCA-HSIC and its Nyström 
approximated variant.

* The **experiments** folder contains scripts that can be used to analyse the 
performance of SCCA-HSIC when the number of related and noise variables
increases. Scripts to test the scalability of the Nyström variant are also 
included.

* The **tutorial** folder contains example scripts to get acquainted with SCCA-HSIC.


## Real Datasets

* [Boston Housing Dataset](http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston_corrected.txt)
* [Body Fat Dataset](https://publicifsv.sund.ku.dk/~tag/Teaching/share/data/Bodyfat.html)
