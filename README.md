"Uurtio, V., Bhadra, S., Rousu, J. Sparse Non-Linear CCA through Hilbert-Schmidt
Independence Criterion. IEEE International Conference on Data Mining 
(ICDM 2018), to appear".

The scca-hsic folder contains the implementation of SCCA-HSIC and its Nyström 
approximated variant.

The experiments folder contains scripts that can be used to analyse the 
performance of SCCA-HSIC when the number of related and noise variables
increases. Scripts to test the scalability of the Nyström variant are also 
included.

The tutorial folder contains example scripts to get acquainted with SCCA-HSIC.
